# StockThoughtPyBot
Python bot to tweet top reddit comments about stocks

Nov 5 Change List:
- Bot script is functional, obviously I just run it on my computer for a little bit at a time since I don't have a server.
- Some small additions need to be made in order to make the program more robust (detailed below)

GOALS:
1) add functionality to cycle through several subreddits
2) keep track of most recent tweets so we can post a unique status every 30 minutes.
